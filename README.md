## JavaScript Fundamentals

Our JS journey begins with understanding a few basic concepts:

### How to add JS Script to your HTML file:

N.B. HTML will be referenced, please make sure you know it's basics before continuing. 

We use the `<script></script>` tag to add JS to a webpage/HTML page. JS scripts can be added in the `head` or the `body` tag in our HTML files.

An example of adding JS in the `body` tag:

```
<body>
    <script>
        // Write your JS code here.
    </script>
</body>
```

An example of adding JS in the `head` tag:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <title>Webpage Title</title>
    <script>
      // Wtite your JS code here
    </script>
</head>
```
