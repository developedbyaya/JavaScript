## Code Editors 

A code editor is where developers write their code as well as debug it(look for and fix errors). Some of the most popular one's are:

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - This is a lightweight and fast text/source code editor, it is not the same thing as Visual Studio.
2. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - This is a full fledged IDE(Intergrated Development Environment). For most people, the community version is enough to get started.
3. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
4. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
